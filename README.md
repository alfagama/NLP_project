## Task:
*“Analysis of public reactions to Coronavirus-related tweets based on geolocation”*

## Dataset(s):
Utilizing the Twitter API, we aim to gather data based on a variety of hashtags related to Coronavirus used on Twitter.

## Evaluation measure:
- Unsupervised ML on data retrieved from Twitter
- Sentiment Analysis

----------------------------------------------------

## Ideas
1. Flow of positive/negative/neutral tweets from 10/12/20 ~= 24/01/20 to subjects:
- covid / coronavirus
- quarantine
- vaccine

e.g. In "vaccine.csv": *"25,dinah_wise,"RT @iCyclone: BAM! We've got a #vaccine. Time to knock out #COVID19. 👊 I'm psyched to get my shots (of course *after* frontline heroes, med…"* -> Positive Tweet!

2. Flow chart between different periods of interest:
- Vaccine announcement
- Vaccine release to UK
- Vaccine release to USA (expected in a week 15-20/12/20)
- ... (Something major that will happen soon! BEWARE!! #spooky)
3. Most common bi-grams / tri-grams / etc... in the covid posts
4. ?
5. ...
